# About me
My name is Yimeng Shang, now a first year Ph.D. student in biostatistics in [Penn State University](https://med.psu.edu/biostatistics-phd). I got my Master's degree in the Mailman School of Public Health in [Columbia University in the city of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/). 

I took courses in Biostatistical method, Probability, Statistical Inference, Causal Inference, Data Science, Clinical Trial Methodology, Survival Analysis, Epidemiology, Adcanced Statistical Computing and Data Mining.

I'm interested in analyzing high-dimensional genomics/metabolomics, and longitudinal data. My research mainly involves doing variable selection, classification, dimension reduction through penalized regression and statistical learning methods. I'm also interested in statistical computing.
